## Theme Support

The portfolio offers seamless switching between **light and dark themes**.  
By default, it adapts to your system settings, but users can manually toggle modes through the theme switcher.

### How It Works

The theme system is implemented using React’s **useContext** API, allowing efficient state management and persistence of user preferences.

- **useContext API** manages theme selection and state.  
- Designed for full **responsiveness** across devices and screen sizes.
